# Authorization Concepts for an API

  - App Key
    - Is a unique identifier for an application, often used to authenticate the app with an API.
    - Is stored in the database as a string along with the app's details 
    - Is given to the application developer when they register their app with the API provider.
    - Is given back to the server when the app makes requests to the API as a header or query parameter.
  - App Secret
    - Is a secret key associated with an application, used to sign requests or authenticate the app.
  - Client
    - Client ID
      - Is a unique identifier for the client application.
      - Is used to identify the application making requests to the API.
      - Is given to the application developer when they register their app with the API provider.
      - Is included in the request to the authorization server when obtaining an access token or authorization code.
    - Client Secret
      - Is a secret key associated with the client application, used to authenticate the client.
      - Is used in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow to exchange the authorization code for an access token.
      - Is stored securely and not exposed to the public.
    - Authorization Code
      - Is a temporary code issued to the client application after the user authorizes access.
      - Is used in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow to obtain an access token.
      - Expires after a short period and can only be used once.
    - Access Token
      - Is a token issued by the authorization server that allows the client to access protected resources on behalf of the user.
      - Can be a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a simple string.
      - Is included in the Authorization header of API requests as a Bearer token.
      - Has a limited lifespan and may need to be refreshed using a refresh token.
      - Is used to authenticate API requests and authorize access to resources.
    - Refresh Token
      - Is a token used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
      - Is issued alongside the access token and has a longer lifespan.
      - Is used in the OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token Flow to refresh the access token when it expires.
